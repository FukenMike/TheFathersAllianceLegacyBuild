      <p>My name is Michael, and I founded The Father's Alliance—not from a boardroom or a comfortable office, but from the trenches of my own painful battle.</p>
      <p>I know what it's like to fight a system stacked against you. I've faced courtrooms that treat children like property, watched caseworkers shuffle paperwork without ever seeing the human lives behind them, and felt the relentless judgment from forms that have no box to check for a single dad fighting for custody. I've tasted homelessness, financial desperation, and the bitter helplessness that comes when every safety net disappears because you simply don't fit their mold.</p>
      <p>My story isn't unique—it's tragically common. Fathers, mothers, and entire families are quietly buried under bureaucratic neglect, unseen and unheard, until the damage becomes irreparable. But my turning point came the day I realized I wasn't just overlooked—I was systematically excluded. My pain wasn't an accident; it was built into the system.</p>
      <p>I founded The Father's Alliance out of rebellion against that truth. Out of refusal to let silence and exclusion be the end of my story or the stories of countless others who shared my struggle. We began as a whisper, a flicker in the dark—a tiny idea: What if we refused to accept the status quo? What if we filled the gaps ourselves, offering real help with dignity, without the red tape and judgment?</p>
      <p>The Father's Alliance exists today to stand in the gap where trauma, poverty, addiction, and bureaucracy collide. We advocate fiercely—not just for fathers, but for families, for children, and for every person who falls through the cracks because the system was never built to support them. We fight for mental health access, vehicle repairs, stable housing, warm beds, and full stomachs. We fight to provide real-world support before the damage becomes permanent.</p>
      <p>My vision for The Father's Alliance goes beyond immediate relief. We're building a future where families can thrive—not just survive. A world where our children grow up in stable homes, where parents aren't forced to choose between food and rent, and where communities rally around each other like a village, creating a support system that catches everyone who falls.</p>
      <p>If my journey has taught me anything, it's that we don't have to accept brokenness as normal. Change is possible. Hope is real. And together, we can rewrite the story.</p>
      <p>This isn't just my story—it's ours.<br/><span class="glow-text">And we are rising.</span></p>
