      <p class="intro-text">
        Family law hasn’t evolved—but families have.
        <br><br>
        Divorce. Custody. Support. CPS.  
        The process is broken—outdated, biased, and blind to the truth behind closed doors.  
        It punishes pain. Profits from separation. And almost never reflects what’s best for the child.
        <br><br>
        Fathers. Mothers. Guardians—we all face the fallout.  
        This alliance was born from that fire.  
        From courtrooms where voices are silenced, stories ignored, and justice feels optional.
        <br><br>
        We rise from that silence—not to beg for change, but to build it.
        <br><br>
        <strong>We. Are. Rising.</strong>

    <h2>The Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
      They say it’s about safety.  
      They say it’s about protecting children.  
      But what they don’t say—what they <strong>never</strong> say—is that this system runs on control, not care.
      <br><br>
      The Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) wasn’t made to heal families.  
      It was made to erase them—quietly, legally, and profitably.  
      <br><br>
      Every year, thousands of children are taken—some abused, many not.  
      They're separated from their parents not because it's necessary, but because it’s <strong>easier</strong>, cheaper, incentivized.  
      <br><br>
      The laws don’t reflect truth.  
      The courts don’t reflect context.  
      The outcomes don’t reflect what’s best for the child.
      <br><br>
      Fathers are erased.  
      Mothers are blamed.  
      Guardians are silenced.
      <br><br>
      This isn’t failure.  
      This is <strong>design</strong>.
      <br><br>
      And we’ve seen enough.
      <br><br>
      This movement wasn’t born in a boardroom.  
      It was born in courtrooms where voices were muted.  
      In foster systems where love was labeled unstable.  
      In homes torn apart because someone, somewhere, got a bonus for removal—not reunification.
      <br><br>
      You want to know why we exist?  
      Look at the paperwork.  
      Look at the silence.  
      Look at the kids who never go home.
      <br><br>
      We are not asking.  
      We are not begging.  
      <strong>We are rising.</strong>

  <section class="section-block" id="vision">
    <h2>What We’re Building</h2>
    <p>
      We've seen families torn apart because a judge didn’t understand their story.  
      We’ve seen fathers erased by paperwork.  
      We’ve seen mothers blamed for asking for help.  
      We’ve seen kids disappear into systems that forget their names.
      <br><br>
      That’s why this alliance exists—not just to speak truth, but to build tools that change it.
      <br><br>
      We're building:
      <ul>
        <li>📍 A nationwide law map exposing policies that harm or help—county by county</li>
        <li>⚖️ A reform engine: petitions, proposals, and pressure for change in family law</li>
        <li>🛠 Real-world aid: emergency housing, custody coaching, legal support</li>
        <li>📚 Survivor-made guides to navigate CPS, court, and custody—with or without a lawyer</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      We’re challenging outdated laws that tear families apart—  
      and building new systems that keep them whole.
      <br><br>
      This is how we rewrite the future—one case, one county, one family at a time.
