        <h1>🟥 Left Side – The Current System</h1>
        <h2>🚫 Public Housing Delays</h2>
        <p>Nationwide, families endure an average wait of over 2 years for subsidized housing—a 42% increase since 2009.</p>
        <p>In states like Massachusetts, the wait can extend to 3.5 years, highlighting the urgent need for reform.</p>
        <h2>⚖️ Family Court Bias Against Fathers</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mothers are awarded sole custody in approximately 80% of cases.</li>
          <li>Fathers often face disproportionate child support obligations without consideration of income.</li>
          <li>Low-income fathers frequently lack adequate legal representation.</li>
          <li>Cultural biases can portray fathers as less nurturing, reducing visitation rights.</li>
          <li>Men are often treated as secondary parents, even when they’re primary caregivers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>🟩 Right Side – The Future We’re Building</h1>
        <h2>🏘️ How do we fix what HUD can’t? We don’t. We build around it.</h2>
        <p>First, we start small—but real.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A one-time deposit to keep a family from losing housing.</li>
          <li>Emergency rent to buy time until court.</li>
          <li>Gas money so someone can get to their housing appointment across town.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then, we build a fund backed by donors and small grants—not to replace HUD, but to catch the people HUD makes wait.</p>
        <p>We won’t promise miracles. But we can promise movement.</p>
        <p>We can promise someone answering <em>now</em>, when the government says <em>maybe next year</em>.</p>
        <blockquote>This isn’t charity. It’s proof that a faster, human response can exist.<br/>And once it’s real—we’ll fight to scale it.</blockquote>
        <h2>👊 Rebalancing Family Law for Fathers &amp; Families</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide pro bono or low-cost legal aid to fathers.</li>
          <li>Advocate for shared parenting models by default.</li>
          <li>Introduce bias training for judges and court staff.</li>
          <li>Build father-focused support networks for legal, emotional, and parental guidance.</li>
          <li>Ensure custody decisions are based on facts—not gender.</li>
        </ul>
