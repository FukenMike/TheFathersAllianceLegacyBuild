      <p>We don’t exist yet—not in the way they define existence.<br/>
      We’re a flicker in the dark.<br/>
      An idea.<br/>
      A spark that hasn’t caught fire—<em>yet</em>.<br/><br/>

      We are not overlooked.<br/>
      We are <strong>filtered out</strong> by design.<br/>
      We are fathers buried under bureaucracy—<br/>
      Flagged, disqualified, shut out of support systems not built for us.<br/><br/>

      We are not missing—we are <strong>excluded</strong>.<br/><br/>

      The Father’s Alliance is born from that truth.<br/>
      From custody battles where children become property.<br/>
      From courtrooms that reward conflict.<br/>
      From systems that turn love into liability.<br/><br/>

      You think TANF is for families? Not ours.<br/>
      You think there’s help for a single dad with full custody? There isn’t.<br/>
      The forms don’t have our box. The aid doesn’t reach our hands.<br/>
      We are left to struggle—but blamed when we fail.<br/><br/>

      So we forged something new.<br/>
      A presence. A pulse. A counterforce.<br/><br/>

      This is rebellion.<br/>
      This is restoration.<br/>
      This is the heartbeat of every father they tried to write out of the story.<br/><br/>

      We are not a whisper anymore.<br/>
      <strong class="glow-text">We are rising.</strong>
